Its creators, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, at the time, thought the name would be a bit difficult to remember, especially considering the target demographic’s younger age range. Consequently, they decided to rename it to Roblox in the same year, and it has stayed like that since. Curiously enough, the game was also called Roblox v 10 around that period.</span></p>

</span></div></div><div class="style__AccordionContainer-sc-ge3ocg-0 cgRxSc"><div class="header"><span class="text">Is Roblox a good game for 7 year olds?</span></div><div class="body"><span class="text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roblox is designed to cater to an audience of all ages, though it’s notably played by younger gamers. As a matter of fact, 67% of Roblox players are under 16, while only 14% are over 25. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the disparity, please remember that Roblox, more than a game, is a platform where everyone can create and share their own games. As such, it’s expected that players could meet players of every age and walk of life. This includes games that could be violent or explicit in concept and design, though Roblox does not allow graphic content outright. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, if security is a concern, parents can adjust the content their children can access through the parental settings in their accounts, as well as secure these settings via PIN.</span></p>

As such, the game is freely accessible by anyone. And in the case of the older player base, in particular, there are quite a few games with more mature themes in the catalog.</span></p>

The gaming platform does not have the functionality to disseminate, retrieve, or upload any harmful code that could result in damage to the system of the user’s files. Similarly, it also can’t retrieve and unlawfully share any user information to third parties.</span></p>

However, Erik Cassel joined Knowledge Revolution in 1998 and, five years after the company’s acquisition by MSC Software Corporation in 1999, the duo split off and founded the Roblox Corporation in 2004, in which went on to release the popular gaming platform that same year.</span></p>
